# JATE-Challenge
## Description
### User Story

```md
AS A developer
I WANT to create notes or code snippets with or without an internet connection
SO THAT I can reliably retrieve them for later use
```
### Solution
To meet the needs of this user story I created a text editor web app that will function without internet connection (PWA).
